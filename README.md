# Timeboxing Platform

## Features

- **Set Daily Goals and Checklist**: Define your daily goals and check them off when completed.
- **Timeboxing with Subtasks**: Organize your tasks into dedicated time slots and break them down into subtasks.
- **Visual Timer**: Visual countdown to help you stay aware of your timebox progress.
- **Brain Dump**: Quickly capture ideas, thoughts, and everything on your mind.
- **History of Completed Timeboxes**: Evaluate your productivity with a date-based history of completed timeboxes.

## Plan Features

- **Audio Timeâ€™s Up Notification**
- **User Login & Save data beyond the local storage**
- **Sync with Google calendar**:
